Hi everyone.
This is just a Hello World can be compiled on Linux for x86 and (I hope it works but cannot check yet) for ARM.
Makefile is written, it supports four configurations:

- all (default) - builds both x86 and ARM modules, after compilation they can be found in ./output/ directory;
- cross - just ARM, output stored in the same place;
- x86 - just x86, the same as cross scenario, but for x86;
- clean - deletes any output.

I know that cross-compiling should be configured in some another way (without storing 500MB of compilers near to 200B of sources), but I don't know how to implement this. Yet.

Best regards,
Andrey Fedchuk
